Description             : HELL HAS BEEN INVADED
                          Invaded by human marines, allied with the empire of
                          the Union Aerospace Corporation.
                          
                          You're an imp. Those of the UAC captured you to
                          make demon-control experiments. Now you have to
                          escape from the UAC and return to your home, Hell!
                          
                          IMPSCAPE is a 7 maps modification for Doom II, for
                          GZDoom. Fight against the UAC forces throught
                          bases, prisons, factories and computers, and burn
                          them with your fireballs!
                          
                          FEATURES:
                          Play as an Imp, a brown bastard from hell, who
                          heaves fireballs down the UAC marines throat (and
                          takes several bullets to die).
                          7 long maps full of marines and UAC forces!
                          2 difficult bossfights!
                          2 types of imp transformations (dark imp and rocket
                          imp).
                          You can grab barrels with use and throw them to
                          enemies!
                          You can free ally monsters to fight against the UAC
                          forces!
                          Available on English and Spanish.
                          
                          INSTALLATION/SETTINGS:
                          To play the mod:
                          You need the GZDoom engine, available here:
                          https://zdoom.org/downloads
                          Also you need the DOOM2.wad game file from the
                          original game, available on Steam/GOG.
                          If you have installed the game from Steam or GOG,
                          or you have the DOOM2.wad file on GZDoom's folder,
                          you can drag and drop the pk7 file to the
                          gzdoom.exe executable to play.
                          
                          GZDoom settings:
                          Dont use software renderer, use hardware renderer
                          instead (OpenGL/Vulkan).
                          Jumping and crouching are blocked, but freelook is
                          recommended (and sometimes required)
