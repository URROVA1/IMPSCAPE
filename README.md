Invaded by human space marines, allied with the empire of the Union Aerospace Corporation.

**You're an imp.** Those of the UAC captured you, and tons of other demons, to make demon-control experiments. Now you have to escape from the UAC and return to your home, Hell!

**IMPSCAPE** is a 7 maps modification for Doom II, for GZDoom. Fight against the UAC forces throught bases, prisons, factories and computers, and burn them with your fireballs!

**To play the mod:**
You need the GZDoom engine, available here: https://zdoom.org/downloads
Also you need the DOOM2.wad game file from the original game, available on Steam/GOG.
If you have installed the game from Steam or GOG, or you have the DOOM2.wad file on GZDoom's folder, you can drag and drop the pk7 file to the gzdoom.exe executable to play.

**GZDoom settings:**
Dont use software renderer, use hardware renderer instead (OpenGL/Vulkan).
Jumping and crouching are blocked, but freelook is recommended (and sometimes required)
