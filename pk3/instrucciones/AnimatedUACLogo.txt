Place the UACPainter actors on your map. Make sure they are facing the correct wall surface,
and make sure they are placed quite close, 8 units should be suffice. Give the UAC Painter a
zheight to adjust the vertical point at which the decal image is 'painted' on the wall.

This only contains an animated UAC logo, but I encourage you to invent your own wall animations
using decals.
